Sol.vim
========

A Light colourscheme for Vim created for fun

This theme compliments the `Luna <https://github.com/Pychimp/vim-luna>`_ colorscheme, which is a dark one.

=====

| Yes, I know Sol .. Solarized ?
|
| I chose Luna (which is the Latin name for Moon), and since this compliments it,
| Sol (which is the Latin name for Sun) seemed apt.
|
| Now I regret (slightly) for choosing Luna and Sol :)

=====

This colorscheme still needs a few more tweaks, but It's still quite useable now.
Take a look at the included screenshots.

This colourscheme is intended for use on:
